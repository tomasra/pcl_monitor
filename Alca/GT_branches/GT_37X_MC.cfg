Scope: Ideal/trivial conditions - perfectly aligned and calibrated detector. Alignment and calibration constants = 1, with no smearing.  Channels which are known will not be functioning at LHC startup are masked, as described [[BadChannelsForMC][here]].

Release: 37X >= 370pre5.  For use with 1E31 HLT menu.
