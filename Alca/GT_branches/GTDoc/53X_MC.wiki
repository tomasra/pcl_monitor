Alignment and calibration constants = 1, with no smearing.  Channels which are known will not be functioning at LHC startup are masked, as described [[BadChannelsForMC][here]]. | As !MC_53_V9 with the following updates:<br> - Updated CSCTF configuration for 2012 running: suppresses rate at high eta region: |eta| > 2.1 allowing L1 muon triggers up to 2.4.<br> - New PF cluster and photon energy corrections.<br> - New ECAL channel status. |
