| [[%LINKTOGTLIST%/?GlobalTag=DESIGN44_V5B][DESIGN44_V5B]] | %GREEN%441%ENDCOLOR% | Ideal/trivial conditions - perfectly aligned and calibrated detector. Alignment and calibration constants = 1, with no smearing.  No bad channels.  *NOTE*: this GT is dedicated to special studies with beam-spot centered at 0,0,0. | As !DESIGN44_V5 with the following updates:<br> - new beam-spot tag with position centered in nominal IP. |
| [[%LINKTOGTLIST%/?GlobalTag=START44_V5F1][START44_V5F1]] | %GREEN%441%ENDCOLOR% | As the 'MC' GT (including bad channels), but with realistic startup alignment and calibration constants. The mis-alignment and mis-calibration scenarios are described [[AlCaScenarios][here]] | As !START44_V5 with the following updates:<br> - failure scenario for strips. |
